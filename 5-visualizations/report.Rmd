# Overview

<br>

This report includes preliminary results for the ELICIT and VITAL studies.

<br>

# Overall Descriptive Epidemiology Plots

<br>

These plots are from data pooled across individual studies. Results are presented in 3 or 6 months intervals and estimates are for cumulative incidence, incidence proportion, incidence rate, prevalence, as well as persistent wasting, weight-for-length z-score (WLZ), mean length-for-age z-score (LAZ) and mean weight-for-age z-score (WAZ).

## Wasting

<br>
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/wasting/CI3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/wasting/IP3.png"))

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/wasting/recovery6.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/wasting/WLZ3.png"))
```

<br>

## Stunting

<br>
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/stunting/CI3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/stunting/IP3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/stunting/LAZ3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/stunting/prevalence3.png"))
```

<br>

## Co-Occurence

<br>
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/co-oc/IP3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/co-oc/prevalence3.png"))
```

<br>

## Underweight

<br>
<br>

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", out.height="50%"}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/underweight/WAZ3.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(BV_dir,"results/figures/underweight/prevalence3.png"))
```

<br>

# Outcome Plots

<br>

These plots (overall and by intervention arm) are for BMI-for-age, height-for-age (HAZ), WAZ, and weight-for-height (WHZ) by study.

BMI-for-age was calculated 

HAZ was calculated 

WAZ was calculated

WHZ was calculated

```

<br>

### VITAL

<br>
<br>

# Descriptive Statistics Tables
<br>

The following tables present estimates by intervention arms in both ELICIT and VITAL studies. These tables are generated from the wide version of the data. As such, they include descriptive statistics for each time point that data was collected.

<br>

## ELICIT
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}
readRDS("/data/KI/imic/results/elicitTable.RDS")
```

<br>

## VITAL
```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="80%", out.height="80%"}
readRDS("/data/KI/imic/results/vitalTable.RDS")
```
